		<h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
		<p>I am somewhat new to coding but I think is what I want to do. I have been in technical sales for many years, but am focusing on coding now. In my free
		time I am a video artist and also like to rock climb. </p>
		
		<h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
		<p>I want a broad base on what coding is and what I can do with it. I think that learning full stack coding is essential to my devlopment as a coder. Plus I like to challenge myself</p>
		
		<h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
		<p>I have taken a Java class, HTML/CSS class, and know some Javascript. I also did learn coding in high school, but not enough to be worth knowing anything much. I am excited to learn more!</p>
		
		<h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
		<p>I am working on a Mac</p>
		
		<h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
		<p>I am very excited to learn these technologies and want to get the most out of it. I will reach out if I have any questions.</p>
